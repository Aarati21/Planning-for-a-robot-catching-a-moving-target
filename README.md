# Planning for a robot catching a moving target

This repository deploys 3D A star in x, y and time to catch a moving target in the least possible times. The heuristic deployed has been delineated in the report and is a function of a backward 2D Dijkstra search. 

The detailed question can be found in the repository. It was posed as the first assignment for 16782 Planning Techniques for Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University. A report showing detailed results has been attached.
